    // SECTION CONTENT (approx. 1100 words across sections)
    const contentText = {
      personal: `George Washington Polk Jr. (1913–1948) was born into a family that encouraged public life and debate. Educated at Hamilton College, Polk moved quickly into journalism, where he built a reputation for clear-eyed reporting, forceful language and a willingness to confront powerful actors. His early life included stints in Europe and Asia; he served in the U.S. Navy during World War II and later returned to correspondence work, joining CBS. Colleagues remembered Polk as energetic, tenacious, and impatient with official spin—traits that would both make him a valuable reporter and expose him to danger in volatile political environments.[1]`,

      early: `Before his arrival in Greece, Polk had reported from multiple theatres. He covered the immediate postwar reconstruction of Europe, reporting on displaced populations and the political realignments that followed the defeat of the Axis. His dispatches before 1947 combined narrative color with an investigative impulse: Polk frequently sought documentary proof and first‑hand testimony for claims of corruption or abuse. These pre‑Greece reports established his reputation in American newsrooms: he was not a passive correspondent who relayed official statements, but a reporter who tested them against field evidence.[2]`,

      greece: `Polk arrived in Greece in 1947 as the country staggered under occupation aftermath and the eruption of civil conflict. The Greek Civil War (1946–1949) pitted royalist government forces—backed financially and diplomatically by Britain and then the United States—against a largely communist insurgency that had substantial roots in wartime resistance groups. Polk’s reporting concentrated on two interlocking themes: first, the human consequences of repression, displacement and violence; second, the use and potential misuse of international aid and military assistance. Polk investigated how American dollars intended for relief and reconstruction could flow through local power brokers and emerge in patronage networks that strengthened particular political factions. His style blended eyewitness testimony (interviews with refugees, soldiers and local officials) and pointed factual claims about contracts, shipments and bank transfers. These claims attracted attention—and hostility—from Greek authorities and some of their Western backers, who feared that critical coverage would undercut their strategic objectives in the early Cold War.[3]`,

      murder: `In May 1948 Polk disappeared after traveling in the Thessaloniki and northern Greece region to follow leads about corruption and militia activity. His body was later recovered in Salonika Bay, bound and shot—an execution-style killing that provoked immediate international outrage. Greek investigators arrested suspects and secured confessions that many later observers called coerced. Subsequent trials produced convictions, but scholarly and journalistic examinations have argued that the evidence presented at trial was inconsistent and that certain confessions were retracted or obtained under duress. Alternative theories emerged: some blamed communist guerrillas; others suggested right‑wing actors or intelligence services had motives to silence Polk or shape the narrative about his death. The unresolved nature of responsibility—and the political pressure to deliver a swift verdict—has made the Polk case a lasting example of how intelligence operations, propaganda, and rushed prosecutions can cloud the truth in wartime contexts.[4]`,

      legacy: `Polk’s death had institutional consequences: Long Island University established the George Polk Awards in 1949 to honor investigative and courageous journalism. Over time the Polk Awards became a hallmark of reporting excellence, recognizing journalists who exposed wrongdoing at local, national, and international levels. For historians and journalists, the Polk case raises durable questions about press protection, the perils of reporting in contested spaces, and the responsibilities of news organizations when their correspondents break sensitive stories. Polk’s name, enshrined in the awards program, thus functions both as a memorial and a reminder of the occupational hazards that accompany investigative reporting.[5]`
