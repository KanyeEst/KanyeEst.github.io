      <section id="early" class="tab-content">
        <h2>Life Before Greece</h2>
        <p>Before his assignments in Greece, Polk reported extensively across Europe and the Mediterranean. He covered political upheavals and social unrest, building experience in war correspondence. He was particularly known for his willingness to challenge authorities and report unpopular truths, a trait that would define his career in Greece.</p>
        <p>His work prior to 1947 includes coverage of the aftermath of World War II, the Nuremberg Trials, and early postwar tensions that foreshadowed the Cold War. Polk’s reporting style combined rigorous investigation with compelling narrative, which earned him positions at CBS and other news outlets.</p>

        <h2>Reporting in Greece</h2>
        <p>Arriving in Greece in 1947, Polk entered a nation still recovering from the Axis occupation and embroiled in civil conflict. His assignments included monitoring U.S. foreign aid usage, investigating political corruption, and documenting the struggle between Greek government forces and communist insurgents.</p>
        <p>Thessaloniki, the city where Polk ultimately met his end, was a focal point for political tensions, with its strategic port and diverse population making it central to both domestic and international interests. Polk's investigative work often brought him into dangerous situations, as he sought to report on the complexities of the Greek Civil War and the influence of foreign powers.</p>

      <section id="murder" class="tab-content">
        <h2>The Murder & Investigation</h2>
        <p>On May 15, 1948, George Polk disappeared while investigating corruption allegations in Northern Greece. His body was found days later in Salonika Bay, bound and shot in the head. The murder prompted widespread international attention and a highly politicized investigation.</p>
        <p>Greek authorities arrested several suspects, but the trials were controversial, with allegations of coerced confessions and political interference. Scholars and journalists have debated the identity of Polk's killers, examining the roles of both local actors and foreign governments. The murder remains a symbol of the dangers faced by journalists in conflict zones and the political pressures of early Cold War Greece.</p>

      <section id="legacy" class="tab-content">
        <h2>Legacy & Awards</h2>
        <p>Polk's death left a lasting impact on journalism. In 1949, Long Island University established the George Polk Awards to honor outstanding reporting. The awards remain among the most prestigious in the field, emphasizing investigative work and courage in the face of danger.</p>
        <p>Polk's approach to reporting—uncompromising and fearless—continues to influence journalists today. His legacy is particularly relevant for those covering politically sensitive or high-risk areas, emphasizing the need for integrity and commitment to the truth.</p>
