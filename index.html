    <h2>George Polk</h2>
    <p>
      George Polk was an American journalist working for CBS who became one of the most
      controversial figures in post–World War II Greek history. Arriving in Greece in 1947,
      Polk covered the Greek Civil War with a reputation for blunt honesty and criticism of
      corruption he witnessed. On May 1948, he disappeared while attempting to interview
      Communist guerrilla leaders in Northern Greece. His body was later discovered in the
      Thermaic Gulf, bound and shot.
    </p>
    <p>
      His murder sparked international investigations and political tension. The U.S. pressured
      the Greek government to find a culprit, leading to a trial that many scholars argue was
      politically motivated. The "Polk case" remains a symbol of Cold War pressures,
      contested justice, and the dangers faced by journalists in politically divided societies.

    <h2>Thessaloniki</h2>
    <p>
      Thessaloniki, Greece’s second-largest city, played a major role in the events surrounding
      George Polk’s death. In the late 1940s, it was a city marked by wartime destruction,
      reconstruction, and political polarization. The port city was a strategic hub between the
      Greek government forces and the Communist Democratic Army operating in Northern Greece.
    </p>
    <p>
      The discovery of Polk’s body in the waters off Thessaloniki intensified international
      scrutiny on the city. In addition to its political significance, Thessaloniki carried the
      weight of its multicultural past: once home to one of Europe’s largest Jewish communities
      before the Holocaust, and a commercial crossroads shaped by Ottoman, Jewish, and Greek
      identities.

    <h2>Greece in the 1940s</h2>
    <p>
      The 1940s were one of the most turbulent decades in Greek history. Following the Axis
      occupation of Greece during World War II, the nation fell into civil conflict between the
      government (backed by the U.S. and Britain) and Communist-led forces who had played a
      major role in wartime resistance. This conflict, known as the Greek Civil War (1946–1949),
      marked the first proxy confrontation of the emerging Cold War.
    </p>
    <p>
      Journalists like George Polk reported on corruption, foreign influence, and the bitter social
      divisions characterizing Greek politics. Many scholars argue that U.S. policy sought to
      stabilize Greece strategically, leading to pressure on Greek authorities to appear strong and
      decisive in the face of Communist threat — a dynamic that contributed to the controversy of
      the Polk investigation.
